### A set of custom nodes that everyone needs! 🎃

This is set of custom nodes for your ComfyUI[^1] local installation. It offers the very basic nodes that are missing in the official "Vanilla" package.
It is a research Node based project on *Artificial Intelligence* using ComfyUI visual editor. This repository also includes a set of workflows to test the nodes.

## 🛡️ Custom Nodes

Here is an overview of the nodes available in this first version of the pack. These correspond to those that I use every day, during my work or in my classes. Others will follow when they are tested and validated. I was inspired by many other developers to create these nodes, even if I had to rewrite most of the scripts myself, for the sake of consistency and integration into comfyUI.

### Image Transform

<table>
<tr><th align="left", width="250">Nodes</th><th align="left", width="432">Values</th><th align="left", width="200">State</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Image Flip</a></td><td align="left">x / y / xy</td><td align="left">✔️</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Image Rotate</a></td><td align="left">Degree /Step: 1)</td><td align="left">✔️</td></tr>
</table>

### Image Postprocessing

<table>
<tr><th align="left", width="250">Nodes</th><th align="left", width="432">Values</th><th align="left", width="200">State</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Image Brigthness</a></td><td align="left">0.0>5.0 / Step: 0.1</td><td align="left">✔️</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Image Contrast</a></td><td align="left">0.0>5.0 / Step: 0.1</td><td align="left">✔️</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Image Greyscale</a></td><td align="left">No value</td><td align="left">✔️</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Image RGB</a></td><td align="left">Red,Green, Blue (0-255 /Step: 1)</td><td align="left">✔️</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Image Difference</a></td><td align="left">2 input images, no value</td><td align="left">⚠️</td></tr>
</table>

### Image Compositing

<table>
<tr><th align="left", width="250">Nodes</th><th align="left", width="432">Values</th><th align="left", width="200">State</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Image Overlay</a></td><td align="left">2 input images, x, y, alpha (RGBA)</td><td align="left">⚠️</td></tr>
</table>

Some extra nodes we need sometimes:

<table>
<tr><th align="left", width="250">Nodes</th><th align="left", width="432">Values</th><th align="left", width="200">State</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Set Text</a></td><td align="left">String</td><td align="left">✔️</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Get Text</a></td><td align="left">String</td><td align="left">✔️</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Note Advanced</a></td><td align="left">String, String</td><td align="left">✔️</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/">Math Operation</a></td><td align="left">a, b, Mode, Type</td><td align="left">✔️</td></tr>
</table>

## 🛡️ Menu Items

One of the principles of creating this node pack is to integrate the node names into the menu, in existing categories, rather than creating a new category. It is quite annoying to have to search for nodes when each developer creates a root category, which makes the menu almost unusable.

## 🛡️ Settings

One of the next planned update is to add a dedicated panel into comfyUI settings window to activate/desactivate each node from the pack. User may use these settings if he wants tu use an alternative node from his installed ones. this avoid getting to much "doubles" into the main node menu.

## 🛡️ ComfyUI Installation and Custom Nodes

After installing [**ComfyUI**](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) services with your prefered plateform (i am suggesting the use of [**Stability Matrix**](https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix) as it is easy to install and give a lot of controls), make sure you install the additional and necessary custom nodes. Then you need to install [GIT software](https://git-scm.com/) (if it is not done already) on your computer. To install these custom nodes, open a CMD window in the \ComfyUI\custom_nodes folder. And "git clone" the Essential Pack. Or you can use the integrated manager:

- [ComfyUi-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)

If you have already ComfyUI installed and working, you can simply copy and paste the **Essential nodes Pack** into the custom nodes folder. Enjoy!

## 🛡️ Development Plan

I'm currently working on a series of new nodes that will be added progressively to this pack. These are mainly oriented towards compositing and post-processing, using either the PIL library or OpenCV.
If you want to follow the progress or/and participate, I invite you to connect with me on [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/urieldeveaud/) and [ComfyUI For AI Media Production](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13109092/), a group of users passionate about AI.
